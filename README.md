<h1 id="title">teachingJS</h1>

This repository contains an introduction to JavaScript. It is still far from complete, but it already aggregates a lot of information on the language.

### Status
- A lot of basic topics are already covered, but the chapter on inheritance needs some overhaul and discussions on builtin object's are missing.
- References are broken.
