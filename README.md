<h1 id="title">teachingJS</h1>

This repository contains an short introductory book on the JavaScript programming language. It is still far from complete, but it already aggregates a lot of information.

### Status
- A lot of basic topics are already covered, but the chapter on inheritance needs some overhaul and discussions on builtin object's are missing.
- References are broken.

### Building
The `build` directory contains builds from the latest snapshot of the book (sometimes including untracked files). PDF-builds are coming soon. There is no need for you to build the book yourself, but if you want to:

- *Linux/Mac OS*: Using the `Makefile` you can build an HTML page from the markdown source. You need to have `make` and `pandoc` installed. 
- *Windows*: Safest bet is to go with [`cygwin`](http://cygwin.com/), `awk`, `make` and [`pandoc`](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/).
