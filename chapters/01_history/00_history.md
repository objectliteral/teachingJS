# The History of JavaScript

The prevailing concepts in a programming language always fit into a certain context. Usually this is about the influences on the creators of a programming language, be it former experience with other languages, personal career background or company management directions. A multitude of factors determines design goals of a language and whether those goals are met or not. So in order to understand a language, to understand why it does certain things, why it follows certain paradigms, it is necessary to put a language's development into context. Especially with JavaScript there is a lot of discussion about what the language got right or wrong and what it wanted to be and what not and what it should be and what not. Maybe a bit of the language's history can give you an idea on why it is what it is.
