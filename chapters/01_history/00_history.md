# The History of JavaScript

The paradigms and concepts of a programming language exist in a certain historical context. Usually this context is a combination of influences on the creators of a programming language. Be it former experience with other languages, personal career background or company management directions, these contextual criteria shape and mold the syntactic, semantic and ideological properties of a language. A multitude of factors determine what the design goals of a language are and whether those goals are met or not can hardly be judged without knowing the historical context. So in order to understand a language, to understand why it does certain things, why it follows certain paradigms, it is necessary to put a language's development into a context. Especially with JavaScript there is a lot of discussion about what the language got right or wrong and what it wanted to be and what not and what it should be and what not. Maybe a bit of the language's history can give you an idea on why it is what it is.
