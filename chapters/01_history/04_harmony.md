## Harmony (2012 and Next)

The Technical Committee TC39 of ECMA International is working on ECMAScript 6 for some time now and there are some features that are already very likely to be part of the next standard edition. The general goals of the next version of the language are the following:
- Adding features that support building large and complex applications,
- making the language a better compile target,
- stripping away troublesome language elements,
- keeping semantic additions to a minimum,
- making the language even easier to write and reduce code length.
ES6 introduces classes and a builtin module syntax in order to make writing large applications easier. It builds on top of ES5 Strict mode which removes some weird statements and behavior. And it includes things like destructuring and default parameters that don't add new behavior to the language but allow you to write much more short and concise code.

While it is not advised to use ES6 features at this moment, I mention some of them throughout this book. If you want to find out more about ES6 support in current implements, (kangax's compatibility table)[http://kangax.github.io/es5-compat-table/es6/] is the place to go.

That should be it for a short peek into what's coming in the future. Some concrete features will be mentioned throughout the rest of the book.
