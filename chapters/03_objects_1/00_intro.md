# 03 Objects Part I

Along with booleans, `null`, numbers, strings and `undefined`, objects are one of the types in JavaScript. As opposed to the other ones, which are called primitive types, objects are more complex constructs.

Objects are the very most important type in JavaScript. They are basically a set of key-value-pairs, which would be called Hash (Perl, Ruby) or HashMap (Java) or Dictionary (Python) or Associative Array (PHP) in other languages. In those languages, objects are thought of to be instances of classes. With classes being abstract concepts, objects are concrete things, that correspond to entities from the real world or the program's problem domain. In JavaScript, there are no classes so objects stand for themselves and are simply collections of values.

### Composition
An object in JavaScript is a set of key-value-paris. The keys have to be strings, while the values can be of any type. A key-value-pair inside an object is referred to as its "property" or "member".
