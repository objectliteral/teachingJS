# Builtins

In the last chapter we have explored a number of ways to create our own objects and we wrote some clever functionsc for that purpose. But we have not yet looked at the useful objects and functions that are part of the language. In this chapter we will look into arrays, strings, the `Date` and `Math` objects and regular expressions.
